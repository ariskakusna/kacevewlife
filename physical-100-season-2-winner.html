At the end of several intense individual and team challenges of brute force, only four finalists remained: Crossfitter Amotti, rugby player Andre Jin, season 1 alum Hong Beom-seok, and South African actor Justin Harvey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/BicMgt8vsY9XGiBUba8HY8-1920-80.jpg><p>The <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/physical-100-season-2-release-schedule/>final battle</a> for season 2's ₩300 million (or about $220,000) wasn't easy, as the finalists had to go through three tough rounds, including holding up their own torso busts for as long as possible and doing an "Infinite Squats" challenge with up to 250 pounds of added weight. Finally, Amotti ended the competition with the win, after beating Hong Beom-seok in a <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD-gKnz6pmI" referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>pole pushing challenge</a>.</p><p>Amotti had plenty of fans cheering for him during his journey towards victory, garnering an impressive fan base even before he joined the series.

However, he had a health scare when he sustained a serious injury in a car accident.</p><p>"I broke my ankle, so I thought I wouldn't be able to work out anymore," he says in the episode. "I can't use my ankle like I used to, but I'm just thankful that I can still work out."</p><p class=newsletter-form__strapline>Marie Claire email subscribers get intel on fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more.

"At that time, the doctor had told me that I may not be able to walk, let alone work out," he explained.</p><p>"I thought I might never walk again, let alone work out, do the thing that I love to do," he said of the injury. "A lot was going through my mind in terms of how am I going to live my life if that were the case going forward. At that time my mother had come to Seoul to look after me for about a month. Watching her take care of me and be there for me, I thought to myself, I cannot collapse here. I'm very proud of what I've done to overcome that time. And to myself back then, I'd like to say thank you for allowing me to be the person I am today."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WALrSqyJSt7kFhv9M3UM2V-1920-80.jpg><p>In his ending speech after being announced as season 2's winner, Amotti spoke on his dedication and shared his respect for his fellow contestants.</p><p>"After I decided to participate in Physical: 100, my daily goal was to work hard in every moment and leave no regrets.

"I did chat with Sung-bin about this and he told me that the shooting period is going to be quite long, so make sure to get rest whenever possible. And he also told me don't get hurt, look after yourself."</p><p>Since Physical: 100 season 2 was filmed last year, several of Amotti's fellow <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/physical-100-season-2-cast/><u>season 2 cast members</u></a> have popped up on his social media, and he's also collaborated on YouTube videos with Hong Beom-seok, Kim Jee-hyuk, Kim Min-su, and Kang So-yeon.
