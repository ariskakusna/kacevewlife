If she does not do this you will need to gently tear open the sac (do not use a sharp object, it's fragile so your hands should suffice) as soon as possible to allow the kitten to breathe. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on countryvet.net</a><h2>Do cats leak blood before giving birth?</h2>Before a cat fully goes into labor, there are a few tell-tale signs.

She will be very protective over them and might not want you touching, so it's best to respect her space unless something is wrong. Sometimes, handling newborns too much can cause their mother to reject them. <span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on cats.org.uk</a><h2>How long is a cat considered postpartum?</h2>The Normal Postpartum Period<p>Involution of the uterus is accompanied by the discharge of lochia from the vulva for up to three weeks.</p><span class=report-it><a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">&nbsp;Takedown request</a></span> <a class=view-url href=# rel="noopener nofollow">View complete answer on therio.vetmed.lsu.edu</a><h2>How many kittens in a litter?</h2>Between one and nine kittens will be born in a litter – most commonly four to six.
