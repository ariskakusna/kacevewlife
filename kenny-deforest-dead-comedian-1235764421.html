He was 37.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On Dec. 8, DeForest was on a rented bicycle at the intersection of Rogers Avenue and Sterling Place in Prospect Park when he hit an unoccupied parked car, a New York City Police Department spokesperson told <a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.nbcnewyork.com/entertainment/entertainment-news/beloved-nyc-comedian-kenny-deforest-dead-after-e-bike-crash-in-brooklyn/4954323/>NBC News.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He was taken to Kings County Hospital, where he underwent neurological surgery to remove a piece of his skull in order to relieve pressure from cranial bleeding.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Ryan Beck, a fellow comic and close friend of DeForest’s, organized a <a href=# rel=nofollow>GoFundMe </a>amid the comedian’s hospitalization. In the most recent update, Beck noted that DeForest’s final moments “included some of his favorite songs, stories of his childhood and memories of his extensive positivity and joy for life.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">LiveOnNY, a nonprofit organization that facilitates organ donation, announced<a href=# rel=nofollow> on social media </a>that on Sunday, DeForest “graciously gifted seven of his organs to five people between the ages of 30 and 75. Kenny gifted his heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and pancreas to recipients waiting for a second chance at life from New York, Pennsylvania, Washington, DC and Indiana.​​”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Beck confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter that DeForest suffered the accident after he “swerved to miss something on the road and lost control of the e-bike and crashed.” The comic remembered his friend as a kindhearted man who was “really invested in other people. He really cared about others, their experience and their well-being. Those feelings of warmth, kindness and encouragement are things I’m really going to miss.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">David Drake, another comic who was close to DeForest, looked back at his friend’s personality with humor: “Kenny convinced me not to walk into these acid pools in Yosemite that I guess kill like, I dunno, 23 people every year. He stopped me from trying to hike to a waterfall in the middle of a desert, 4 miles, uphill, with no water, in my flip-flops. He helped me descend a mountain in Zion after a landfall had wiped out the trail. I guess what I’m saying is I’m in trouble now.​​”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">He added to THR, “I hosted and produced Kenny’s most recent special [<a href=# rel=nofollow>Don’t You Know Who I Am?</a>], but he forgot to include my name in the credits. He did not forget to include his middle school basketball coach.​​”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Drake also noted that nearly two months before his death, DeForest created a “<a href=# rel=nofollow>Funeral Playlist</a>” on Spotify.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“I was looking through the music and he has a couple Rage Against the Machine songs on there and I just want to call him and be like ‘What is this? When would you like us to play ‘Killing in the Name of’? Would you like us to throw the casket in the hole?'” Drake said. “What hurts so much about this experience is there are just so many things about Kenny’s death that are funny and absurd that I know we would laugh really hard about, but instead I’m just sharing them with you.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">On social media, many paid their respects to the late comedian.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">In a <a href=# rel=nofollow>statement shared on social media</a>, Late Night wWith Seth Meyers paid tribute to DeForest, writing, “Kenny DeForest was a universally beloved comedian who died tragically and much too young. His relaxed, confident delivery always stood out. As you can see from his debut late night set on LNSM, he wasn’t afraid to tackle controversial topics but never just to be edgy — always in service of an original angle and a great joke. It’s a shame we won’t get to see what he comes up with next.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Comedian and Fire Island star Joel Kim Booster <a href=# rel=nofollow>tweeted</a>, “Love you forever Kenny. One of the most genuinely supportive, funny guys who always always always made me feel welcome in the boys club, never made me feel like a sideshow and told me to fuck ’em whenever I was doubting myself. I’m going to miss you so much.​​”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Actor James Adomian penned a lengthy tribute to DeForest on <a href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a>, remembering him as “everyone’s best friend.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGebmruvxYydnJ%2BnoprAtXnDnpidZZOkuqawyJqlZmliaIJ4gpNtaWpn</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkenny-deforest-dead-comedian-1235764421.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fkenny-deforest-dead-comedian-1235764421.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fkenny-deforest-dead-comedian-1235764421.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fkenny-deforest-dead-comedian-1235764421.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkenny-deforest-dead-comedian-1235764421.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkenny-deforest-dead-comedian-1235764421.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./kim-cattrall-nude-love-scenes-sex-and-the-city.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./kim-cattrall-nude-love-scenes-sex-and-the-city.html>Kim Cattrall Felt Vulnerable Filming 'Sex and the City' Nude Scenes</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./katie-holmes-daughter-suri-cruise-towers-over-mom-rare-outing-nyc.html>Katie Holmes' lookalike daughter Suri, 17, almost towers over her mother in rare NYC outing</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./katie-holmes-daughter-suri-cruise-towers-over-mom-rare-outing-nyc.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
