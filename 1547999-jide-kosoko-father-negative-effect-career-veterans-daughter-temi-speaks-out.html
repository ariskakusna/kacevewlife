And life after school has been almost the same because in truth I am just coming out of it, I can't really say much about what is going to be right now.

First of all, It usually makes people have an impression about you that's totally wrong. "Many people see you, and they automatically think you're proud, so before you can even prove to them that you're not they are already giving you attitude. There are so many places that I work into and once they know that I'm Jide Kosoko's daughter they all just start giving me attitude."<p class=align-left>Speaking about the height of expectation that also comes with being an actor like her parents, Temi said:</p>"When it comes to being featured or starred in movies, they almost always expect you to do more. Even if you're doing it perfectly and you get the role, you will hear people say things like, ehn she got it because she's the daughter of this and that. This is not true because I have actually put in the effort to get the role.
