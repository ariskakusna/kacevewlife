There were expensive ones that would break the bank, or really cheap bad quality ones.</p><p>“That was a bit of a light bulb moment.”</p><p>The pair went on to launch men’s swimwear brand Vacay Swimwear in 2017.</p><p>They barely eked out a living at first while their marketing mates earned big pay cheques.</p><p>But the economic pain ultimately paid off.</p><p>Fast forward six years and Vacay Swimwear made $4.5 million in the last financial year and is on track for the same amount come June.</p><p>Two months ago, they struck a massive deal with a major brick-and-mortar Canadian retailer, Hudson’s Bay, in a move that will see their products widely stocked in North America.</p><p>When Mr Kallios and Mr Decandia returned from their trip, they sunk everything they had into the business venture.</p><p>“We had about $20,000 each, we literally emptied our bank accounts and poured it all into the business. All the money we made is from that initial amount,” Mr Kallios told news.com.au.<br></p><p>Getting Vacay Swimwear off the ground coincided with their final university exams. They were 21 at the time.</p><p>“We were planning Vacay Swimwear, the logos, branding, products, samples, building the website, creating an influencer list, registering our business name, setting up a trademark – we were doing that while we were studying for our last exams,” Mr Kallios said.</p><p>It launched as an online-only platform at first. For the first year of the business, sales were painfully low.</p><p>“We were only making $300 a week when all our marketing mates were raking in $80,000 a year,” Mr Kallios lamented.</p><p>But then things started to take off.</p><p>After two years Vacay Swimwear “started getting the attention” of big brands.</p><p>Their products are now stocked in David Jones department stores and their board shorts are also available to purchase through shopping website The Iconic.</p><p>They also have a large international online presence.</p><p>North America is their biggest market, with Americans and Canadians making up 70 per cent of their overall online sales.</p><p>This is how they were able to score a deal with Canadian department store Hudson’s Bay earlier this year.<br></p><p>In Europe, they have customers in Germany, France, Italy, Belgium and Austria.</p><p>Vacay Swimwear is stocked on an online platform called Zalando, which attracts a lot of European buyers.</p><p>They also sell products in New Zealand.</p><p>Now 28, the pair understand a thing or two more about running a business.</p><p>They get to travel the world for trade shows.</p><h4 class=g_font-title-xxs>More Coverage</h4><p>The duo’s company turned over an eye-watering $1 million in its best month last year, in November, during the Black Friday sales.</p><p>“Given people are being conservative with their spending, lots of people were waiting for the Black Friday, so we forecasted to do a $1 million in sales,” Mr Decandia said. “We planned for eight months, programmed our website to make it achievable, we went all in.”<br></p><p>There are now 10 people who work under them to keep the business ticking along.</p><span class=title>Read related topics:</span><a class=topic_tag href=# data-tgev-container=story-topic-links data-tgev-label=Adelaide data-tgev-order=1 data-tgev-metric=npv data-tgev=event10>Adelaide</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrGWcp51jrrZ7xaKlmqaTmnyjwdKipZ6ro2S%2FpsDAoqNomZSauaK1w55km62jnrumv9JmrZqbka56tMPIpq6emaJiuqK3xKxkbW2dYrmiusOsZJ2dkaF6uLXToWSmmZqkv26vwKeYnaGRo3qzsdOaoKWdomS7psPSZqqtp6KufKWuw3Kda3GWlrKjr5idbJ6eZmeBeYKWcWpxaJGXs3mu</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fadelaide-business-vacay-swimwear-makes-45m-lands-deal-with-major-canadian-retailer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fadelaide-business-vacay-swimwear-makes-45m-lands-deal-with-major-canadian-retailer.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fadelaide-business-vacay-swimwear-makes-45m-lands-deal-with-major-canadian-retailer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fadelaide-business-vacay-swimwear-makes-45m-lands-deal-with-major-canadian-retailer.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fadelaide-business-vacay-swimwear-makes-45m-lands-deal-with-major-canadian-retailer.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fadelaide-business-vacay-swimwear-makes-45m-lands-deal-with-major-canadian-retailer.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./basketball.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./basketball.html>Basketball</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./adam-ezra-net-worth-income-salary-html.html>Adam Ezra Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./adam-ezra-net-worth-income-salary-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
