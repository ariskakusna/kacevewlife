There's no need to remove the newspaper because you can turn it back into the soil each year when you replant the site.<h2>How long does it take for newspaper to decompose in garden?</h2>How Long Does it Take for Newspaper to Decompose in the Garden?

Water after mulching â€” This is an optional step, but a final watering can help settle the mulch into place.<h2>Should I put plastic down under mulch?</h2>When using mulch in your landscape, there is no need for the use of artificial weed barrier such as plastic or landscape fabric. These materials do not work and are not weed barriers. They are only necessary under stone. That is to prevent the soil from mixing with the stone.<h2>Can I just put mulch over weeds?</h2>Weeds need light and warm soil to survive. To use mulch as a natural weed barrier, you need to put down a 2- to 3-inch layer. That's enough to keep most weed seeds from sprouting. Because you block their access to sunlight, they won't have enough energy to push through the mulch.<h2>Should you pull weeds before mulching?</h2>Get Rid of Weeds Before Mulching<p>While a good layer of mulch can smother small, young weeds, don't expect it to magically eliminate well-established weeds.

Removing pre-existing mulch every year only ends up to be extra work and a needless expense.<h2>How deep should your mulch be?</h2>The general recommendation is about 3 inches of mulch in a planting bed. Many materials like wood chips settle so add an extra 1/2 to 1 inch of the material to account for the decrease in volume. For mulch made of grass clippings, decrease the depth to under 1 inch.<h2>How often should you replace mulch?</h2>At most, you will need to replace your mulch once a year.
