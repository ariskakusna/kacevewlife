After seeing megachurch pastor Joel Osteen holding a “Night of Hope” religious conference in Louisville and demanding a charge or ticket cost of $15 to attend, I’m a little disillusioned with the religious establishment. Seats in the first row are more expensive. For the privilege of bringing you the message of God, he is charging you money.</p><p></p><h3>There were 27 related questions and answers found.</h3><p></p><h3>What is the name of the world’s wealthiest pastor, and where did he come from?</h3><p>David Oyedepo is a Nigerian actor.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-149 data-inserter-version=2></span><p></p><h3>What is the value of a Creflo Dollar?</h3><p>Creflo Dollar is reported to have a net worth of $27 million, with the majority of his wealth derived from his ministerial institutions around the United States of America.
