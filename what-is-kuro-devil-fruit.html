Speed is his primary asset, with his legs being powerful enough to cross 100 meters within five seconds.<h2>Captain Kuro, The Master Strategist - One Piece Discussion | Tekking101</h2><p></p><h2>Why did Kuro turn into a ball?</h2>Licht fights pretty well against Higan, but he is already wounded and weakened due to Lawless absence. Mahiru sends Kuro into the fight, but suddenly, he loses his physical form and turns into a small, black ball. Being totally shocked, Mahiru is unable to move.<h2>How did Luffy beat Kuro?</h2>Kuro yells that his plan will never fail but he is cut off by a second head butt by Luffy. This incredibly strong headbutt knocks Kuro completely out. The Black Cats marvel at Luffy's strength saying that even the strongest marines couldn't defeat Kuro.<h2>Is there a Mizu Mizu no mi?</h2>The Mizu Mizu no Mi (lit Water Water Fruit) is a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to control and become liquid water.<h2>What is Kaku Devil Fruit?</h2>The Kaku Kaku no Mi (核分裂核分裂フルーツ, Fission Fission Fruit) is a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit that grants the user the ability to split atoms, essentially making them a living nuclear weapon and endless energy resource.<h2>Which is the weakest Devil Fruit?</h2>1 Weakest: Beri Beri no Mi<p>Beri Beri no Mi is a Paramecia type of Devil Fruit that allows its user to turn their body into small spheres.

Fans last saw Kuro in the Loguetown Arc, where he was notified of Luffy's newly placed bounty.<h2>Is there a cloud Devil Fruit?</h2>The Kumo Kumo no Mi is a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to create, control, and transform into cloud at will, turning the user into a Cloud Human (雲人間 Kumo Ningen). The nature of this Devil Fruit also allows the user to change the weather. "Kumo" is the Japanese word for cloud. It was eaten by Domino.<h2>What is Cobys power?</h2>Due to his harsh training regime under Garp as well as further training after two years, Koby possesses immense physical strength and speed. He has shown himself to be an excellent swimmer. He can move incredibly fast even when underwater, as he caught up to a torpedo within seconds.<h2>Which is the strongest Devil Fruit?</h2>Bari Bari no Mi allows the user to produce unbreakable barriers, giving them protection from most enemies in their way in the process. Even someone as strong as Kozuki Oden couldn't break the barrier produced by this fruit, making it the most powerful Devil Fruit when it comes to defense.<h2>What fruit does Khalifa have?</h2>Kalifa ate the Awa Awa no Mi, a Paramecia-type Devil Fruit which allows her to create and manipulate soap bubbles that can clean anything.<h2>What fruit does Lucci have?</h2>Rob Lucci ate the Neko Neko no Mi, Model: Leopard, a Zoan-type Devil Fruit which allows him to transform into a full leopard, a bulky leopard-human hybrid and, by using Seimei Kikan, a slender leopard-human hybrid.<h2>Does CP9 have Haki?</h2>Something interesting to note, all CP9 members are said to have observation and armament haki.<h2>What if a Fishman eats a Devil Fruit?</h2>A fishman devil fruit user would not be able to swim in the ocean, but obviously wouldn't drown if he fell into the sea, he would be stuck. [ just like what happened to Jack when Zunisha drowned his fleet.]<h2>Can a Devil Fruit user swim in freshwater?</h2>Fresh or salt water, it doesn't matter, it still drains a devil fruit user of their strength as long as it's ankle deep. We've seen Luffy and others exposed to fresh water and still be unable to swim.<h2>Who is Kirin Kusogawa?</h2>Kusogawa Kirin is originally a character created for a fan made Naruto-based RP on the online community site GaiaOnline in 2005. She was later adapted for use in a One Piece RP on the same site in September of the same year.<h2>Who was Luffy's hardest enemy?</h2><p>One Piece: Monkey D.
