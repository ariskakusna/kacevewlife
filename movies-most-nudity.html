But there are also more subtle reasons why people—especially women—might prefer a Hollywood film with realistic nudity and simulated sex scenes to...what you might find elsewhere on the internet. For example, where much explicit content considers male pleasure the goal of sex, Hollywood movies with nudity tend to contain more nuance, creating emotional connections between characters and using <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g22576220/romantic-sex-scenes/>romantic sex scenes</a> to advance the story. Plus, with the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-redirect=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a13027952/the-making-of-outlander-sex-scenes/ data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g5018/outlander-things-you-never-knew/><u>rise in intimacy coordinators on-set</u></a> to make sure the actors feel comfortable and safe, viewers might feel more secure and ethical watching Hollywood sex scenes.</p><p>It is with this nuance in mind that Marie Claire has compiled a list of the best movies with nudity, categorized by genre. Below, you’ll find classic nude movies, like 9 ½ Weeks and Eyes Wide Shut, as well as movies that approach nude scenes in ways that are fascinating and funny, like Canterbury Tales and Boogie Nights. Some of these movies have all the glamor of Hollywood with full-frontal nudity thrown in, like Room in Rome and The Dreamers. Plus, you’ll even find some titles where depictions of nudity get elevated to award-worthy heights, like Nymphomaniac and Lust, Caution.</p><p>This list includes something for everybody, genre-wise—with the important caveat that all of these entries contain some pretty explicit depictions of the naked human form.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-romantic-nude-movies><span>Romantic Nude Movies</span></h2><h2 id=39-lady-chatterley-39-s-lover-39-2022-3>'Lady Chatterley's Lover' (2022)&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RSuvvMqKXCFWWA7MQmFrqW-1920-80.jpeg><p>Based on the classic, controversial book, this romantic drama follows the aristocratic Connie (Emma Corrin) who finds herself married to a man she no longer loves. So what does she do? Start an incredibly steamy affair with her estate's gamekeeper, of course.

It really doesn't get much more mainstream or nude than 50 Shades of Grey. What started out as an erotica series became a cultural phenomenon when the first film of the three-part series premiered in 2015. Nudity-wise, this is pretty tame compared to the rest of the movies on this list, but don't get me wrong. This movie, as well as the rest of the installments, are plenty steamy.</p><h2 id=39-blonde-39-2022-3>'Blonde' (2022)&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/q9YRDgn7rDAWqkT5pdv4jB-1920-80.jpeg><p>Don't get it wrong: This is a fictionalized recount of Marilyn Monroe's life, but it's still just as glamorous (and certainly unglamorous) as you would expect from the Old Hollywood bombshell. Ana de Armas takes a turn as Marilyn in a role that would earn her an Oscar nomination. It's for sure a divisive movie, but it's one you can't look away from.</p><h2 id=39-passages-39-2023-3>'Passages' (2023)&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/miZBrNqT54bdkspRbJpzDN-1920-80.jpeg><p>This recently released French film will have you questioning all of your morals, guaranteed. It follows a gay couple who have a seemingly perfect marriage until one of them impulsively starts an affair with a woman. The three actors who make up the love triangle (Adèle Exarchopoulos, Franz Rogowski, Ben Whishaw) are unbelievably good and if you couldn't tell by the trailer, so hot.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-thriller-nude-movies><span>Thriller Nude Movies</span></h2><h2 id=39-neon-demon-39-2016-3>'Neon Demon' (2016)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qjShdsHRtDoue4ndq3hhdc-1920-80.jpeg><p>Elle Fanning is an aspiring young model who venutes to Los Angeles to find her fame and fortune.
