If you haven't picked up the ball by the time you jump, you can pivot. If you pick up the ball in the midst of/before the first step that you jump from, you may not pivot.<h2>Why did basketball get rid of the jump ball?</h2>The reason that the N.C.A.A. eliminated the jump ball from everything but the beginning of the game and the start of overtime was mostly because of officiating. Coaches bemoaned poor tosses and unevenly governed rules about the movement of players around the circle.<h2>Does a jump ball count as a rebound?</h2>REBOUND (REB)<p>A rebound is credited to a player when: A player who immediately gains possession of the ball after a missed shot.
