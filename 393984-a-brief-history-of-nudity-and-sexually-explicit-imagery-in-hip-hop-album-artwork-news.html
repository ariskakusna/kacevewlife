This is disgusting!”</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>While the debate as to whether Meek Mill was right or wrong to have wrapped that vehicle with his sexually graphic album cover is a worthwhile conversation, the backlash against the artwork as a standalone piece prompts a different discussion. From John Lennon and Yoko Ono’s </span><span>Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins</span><span> in 1968 to Halsey’s newly released album </span><span>If I Can’t Have Love, I Want Power</span><span>, nudity and sexually explicit imagery have been present on album covers for decades.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Naturally, the shock of seeing body parts that are typically kept private has resulted in several iconic album covers being condemned by fans and critics alike, and as a result, many artists have been forced to partially censor their artwork or change the covers entirely. While many consumers understandably want to shield youth from nude imagery, that perspective often doesn’t translate to settings where nudity is framed as high art, like in Francois Clouet’s 16th-century painting, </span><span>Gabrielle d'Estrées et une de ses sœurs</span><span>.</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><span>Speaking to that point,&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Killer Mike recently came forward</a> to defend Meek Mill’s album cover for </span><span>Expensive Pain</span><span>. “It's art,” the Run the Jewels rapper and activist argued. “We as a society see naked humans in art in museums. We should also be cultured enough as adults and parents to have a convo about nudity and art with our children. I say this as a parent, rapper and a High Museum of ART Board member.”</span></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Regardless of how you personally feel about the use of nudity in album artwork, <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">popular album covers are going to be scrutinized</a>, whether artists go the Drake route with playful, kid-friendly artwork or the Meek Mill route with sexually explicit imagery. In light of the discourse that the controversial </span><span>Expensive Pain </span><span>artwork has sparked, here is a survey of some of the most NSFW album covers in Hip-Hop history.</span></strong></p><p><h2>Luke - In The Nude (1993)</h2></p><p>Luke/Lil Joe Records</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong><span>Anyone familiar with Uncle Luke’s legacy knows about his Miami-based Hip-Hop group 2 Live Crew and the boundaries that they pushed with albums like 1988’s </span><span>Move Somethin'</span><span> and 1989’s </span><span>As Nasty as They Wanna Be</span><span>. While 2 Live Crew’s most controversial album covers primarily featured bikini-clad women, Uncle Luke’s 1993 solo album was even more graphic, especially considering the time period in which it was released. On the uncensored version of the cover, Luke and four women pose completely nude in a bathtub, with soap suds and strategic hand placements keeping the cover from becoming too X-rated.</span></strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"></p><p><h2>Master P - The Ghetto’s Tryin to Kill Me!
