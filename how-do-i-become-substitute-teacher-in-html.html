getting you there in a flash – </span><strong>around 11 hours and 15 minutes</strong><span>.</span><span> Layover flights,</span><span> on the other hand,</span><span> are more like a leisurely stroll through a duty-free wonderland,</span><span> taking anywhere from </span><strong>20 to 30 hours</strong><span> depending on the number of stops and your chosen airline's entertainment selection (think endless reruns of Friends or a documentary marathon on the history of sporks).</span></p><p data-sourcepos=9:1-9:333><strong>Here's the thing:</strong><span> While a direct flight gets you there
