However, there are also other types of men.</p><p class=align-left>Some of the commonly known types are alpha, beta, omega, gamma, delta, and sigma. You can have a look at the characteristics of each of these types:</p><ul><li><strong>Alpha</strong> - confidence, leadership, charisma</li><li><strong>Beta </strong>- friendliness, submissiveness, reserved nature, loyalty</li><li><strong>Gamma </strong>- love for adventures, eagerness, awareness, empathy</li><li><strong>Omega </strong>- self-assurance, drive, intelligence, diverse interests</li><li><strong>Delta </strong>- resignation, resentfulness, self-sabotaging, loneliness</li><li><strong>Sigma</strong> - cunningness, self-confidence, likability, calculative nature</li></ul><p class=align-left>Since this article explores the nature of the gamma male type, here is a deeper analysis of it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f1196bca01fbeaf6.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Call of the void: why do we feel the urge to jump off high places?</span></p></a><h2>Gamma male definition</h2><p class=align-left>What is a gamma male? While it may be quite hard to define gamma male in a few words, there are a few common ways to describe it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f1196bca01fbeaf6.jpg><p class=align-left>The alpha male is considered to be a confident leader who has outgoing traits and takes charge where needed. He exudes charisma and charm wherever he goes and attracts a lot of people who want to be his friend or form a romantic relationship with him. However, the alpha does not commit easily, and can often be portrayed as a player.</p><p class=align-left>The beta male, on the other hand, is friendly, shy, and respectable towards other people. He is reserved and treats others with kindness, which can often be seen as a weakness or deem him a pushover. Normally, an alpha is considered to be more attractive for short-term flings than a beta, and a beta would make a more loyal partner.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/67acf19dc6fe9ea3.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ great sibling quotes to share with your brothers and sisters</span></p></a><p class=align-left>This brings us to the definition of gamma male - The gamma male is a healthy combination of the best traits that the alpha and beta types possess. This is the type that most people subconsciously seek.</p><p class=align-left>A gamma is a leader like an alpha and sets boundaries around himself, yet treats his romantic prospects with respect and security. His priority is to make his partner comfortable, although he would never sacrifice his own needs for their happiness.</p><h2>Gamma male personality</h2><p class=align-left>This type of men is generally considered to be a more mature version of alpha. He enjoys having fun and going out; however, at the same time, he still tends to his responsibilities and does not get lost in recklessness.</p><p class=align-left>A gamma is an adventurous person who likes social hangouts and parties. He gets quite restless when he has to remain idle for a long time.</p><p class=align-left>However, he does not play with people's feelings, like alphas normally do. He shows a lot of dedication towards his romantic partner, yet does not forget about his own necessities.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e2d5b6d2dc0e8959.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is fragile masculinity and signs you might be suffering from it</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Generally, this type is often known as a "refined alpha".</p><h2>Gamma male traits</h2><p class=align-left>Here are the main traits of this category, explained in more depth.</p><h3>1. Adventurousness</h3><p class=align-left>It is no secret that the gamma is considered a combination of a few personality types. None of them seems dominant over the others, and this type of man just possesses a few qualities from each that balance each other out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/c607d15ae3014fbe.jpg><p class=align-left>The reason for this is his adventurous nature and a desire for creating his own path, without much consideration of what others think of his choices. He will do anything to ensure that his life is fulfilling, instead of relying on people's opinions.</p><p class=align-left>He normally has a range of diverse interests and never gets bored. This makes him enjoy exploring life and learning new things.</p><h3>2. Eagerness</h3><p class=align-left>In addition, he is the kind of person who is eager to experience as much of life as possible. He treasures various experiences he has and craves learning more new skills.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/f06884896ecceed1.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is a power couple and how can you become a part of one?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Sometimes, he can also be eager to get people's love and affection. Although he is an independent type, he can still have these needs.</p><h3>3. Awareness</h3><p class=align-left>One trait that makes a gamma male stand out is his awareness of his actions and their effect on others. Quite often, he is considered to be what an alpha could have been if he was more self-aware.</p><p class=align-left>As he is aware of what he does right and wrong, this helps him to get into people's good books and avoid misunderstandings.</p><h3>4. Empathy</h3><p class=align-left>The empathy trait is another factor that helps this type of man avoid awkward social situations. He empathizes with others and understands what they are going through, which allows him to be a good support system for them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/67acf19dc6fe9ea3.jpg><p class=align-left>He can reassure and comfort others who are going through a hard time, which makes him likeable. Additionally, he is often considered to be a level-headed type - more so than an alpha or beta.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/fc8bce5deaf7c64f.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Most common dere types found in anime and manga explained</span></p></a><p class=align-left>A gamma male is often a perfect balance between a self-assured and reckless alpha and a soft and loyal beta.
