What resulted is now known as <a href=# id=auto-tag_ex-husbands_1 data-tag=ex-husbands>Ex-Husbands</a>, a drama-comedy about Griffin Dunne’s Peter Pearce, a New York dentist who’s still reeling from his parents’ divorce six years earlier. Peter must now also come to terms with his dying father (Richard Benjamin) and his own impending divorce from Maria (Rosanna Arquette).&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Serving as the Palm Springs International Film Festival’s closing night film on Jan. 13, Pritzker’s second feature follows Peter to Tulum, Mexico, where he reluctantly crashes the bachelor party that his youngest son, Mickey (Miles Heizer), organized for his oldest son, Nick (James Norton). Together, the trio must find a way through their own individual problems as their family begins anew. Pritzker recently spoke with THR about working out his own familial struggles on the page and screen and calling attention to a specific environmental issue in the Tropical Atlantic realm.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>One of the questions that this movie asks is whether it’s worth it to get divorced at an older age …</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Yeah, I really wrestled with my parents’ decision to separate after 35 years. I had this idea that after a certain amount of years, you just grind it out no matter what, whether or not you’re happy. And in many ways, I’m grateful that they decided to start fresh in their 60s. You take for granted that what you really want to see is other people&nbsp;trying to find their own piece of&nbsp;happiness.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Did this endeavor help you make peace with your folks’ situation?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I’m still in it, and I don’t know that I have quite enough distance yet to think about whether or not it’s been therapeutic or torturous. I try to leave the personal therapy&nbsp;out of the experience on set and instead task myself, my friends, my wife and my therapist with that work.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Indie filmmaking is not for the faint of heart. Did you have to scratch and claw to pull this off?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Yeah, it took a really long time. We were further waylaid by the pandemic, but I met Griffin Dunne before it, so I stayed in touch with him and rewrote the script during the pandemic. I was once worried that my own wedding would interrupt the shooting of this movie, but three years later, I was still trying to get it made. I feel both pride and shame in how long it takes to make a movie.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What did Griffin add to the Peter Pearce character that may not have been on the page?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I was making a movie about a man in his 60s, and I am not that age. So, to have the perspective of&nbsp;somebody [like Dunne] —&nbsp;who’s been married and divorced, lost parents, raised a child —&nbsp;that was something that I probably took for granted during writing. So Griffin, Rosanna Arquette and Richard Benjamin all brought a lot of lived&nbsp;experience.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>Ex-Husbands shines a light on the sargassum problem in Tulum and the Tropical Atlantic. Did you discover its presence during location scouting and write it into the film?&nbsp;</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It had always been written for Tulum, but when we got there to scout, the beaches were covered in sargassum. Tulum is on the front lines of global warming, and you really feel the rot and a heaviness about that. I originally felt intimidated by the idea of a major change to the script, and I wondered if we needed to look elsewhere. But these guys go on a vacation that does not go the way they want it to, and so I quickly realized how perfect the sargassum was. I’ve never seen a movie with a beach covered in sargassum, and I found it to be this amazing cinematic texture.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m"><strong>What do you want moviegoers to take away after seeing your film?</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">I want people to feel for this father and his sons, as these sensitive guys try to figure out how to support each other through their own crises. I hope people find some humor and solace in that.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">This story first appeared in the Jan. 4 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine. <a href=#>Click here to subscribe</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8yoraKdo2S6sMLInmSfnZGpwrOx0milqJmYYr2ztdOznKtlopqurXnLop2eZZSew7C%2Bwp5koqajpbazscNmnLFlmKrAo63NnapmpZ%2BrtqZ5kGtqbm9nbYJ0fI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnoah-pritzer-real-life-divorce-inspired-ex-husbands-movie-1235778530.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnoah-pritzer-real-life-divorce-inspired-ex-husbands-movie-1235778530.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnoah-pritzer-real-life-divorce-inspired-ex-husbands-movie-1235778530.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnoah-pritzer-real-life-divorce-inspired-ex-husbands-movie-1235778530.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnoah-pritzer-real-life-divorce-inspired-ex-husbands-movie-1235778530.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnoah-pritzer-real-life-divorce-inspired-ex-husbands-movie-1235778530.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./pharrell-williams-something-in-the-water-returns-to-virginia-beach-in-2023.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./pharrell-williams-something-in-the-water-returns-to-virginia-beach-in-2023.html>Pharrell Williams Something In The Water Returns to Virginia Beach In 2023</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./199658-nike-urged-to-recall-air-max-720s-with-logo-resembling-allah-in-arabic-news.html>Nike Urged To Recall Air Max 720s With Logo Resembling &amp;quot;Allah&amp;quot; In Arabic</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./199658-nike-urged-to-recall-air-max-720s-with-logo-resembling-allah-in-arabic-news.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
