Some of the most popular series in South Korea are variety shows that have been staples of international primetime TV for over a decade—and the rise of streaming has finally allowed the unique competition series to find a global audience. (Add in a recent influx of can't-miss dating shows, and Korea has become home to some great new series that sit among the <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g26742354/best-reality-shows/>best reality shows of all time</a>.)</p><p>Korea's unscripted TV slate truly has something for everyone: If you're a fitness buff or are thrilled by seeing people pushed to their physical limits, there's Korean survival shows. If you're the type of person who plays along with Jeopardy or tries to solve <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/g28513718/best-murder-mystery-movies/>mystery movies</a> before the twist is revealed, there's several complex puzzle shows. Here, we've listed a selection of best Korean reality shows to watch—grouped by the most popular genres—to welcome you into the world of K-reality.</p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-dating-shows><span>Dating Shows</span></h2><p>These dating-focused series are more introspective than anything Western media puts out—think more Terrace House than Love Island—but that doesn't mean viewers won't get sucked into rooting for couples or thirsting over fan-favorites. These series often have two layers—as the contestants mingle and flirt, a panel of celebrity hosts serve as audience surrogates, watching along and giving commentary. If you like your vicarious viewing with much less stress (a.k.a. the opposite of Love Is Blind), give these shows a try.</p><h2 id=39-single-39-s-inferno-39-3>'Single's Inferno'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/TuEyPGTSwpVydMKggzTnK7-1920-80.png><p>Single's Inferno has become a proven gateway show for new fans of Korean unscripted TV.

Every season, a group of <a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-before-rewrite-localise=https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/tv-shows/singles-inferno-season-3-cast/>gorgeous young singles</a> are ferried to an abandoned island, dubbed "Inferno," where they get to know each other while living in tents and cooking their own basic meals. If a couple successfully pairs up, they get to have an overnight date in "Paradise," a.k.a. a nearby luxury hotel. Countless viewers have become engrossed by the show's pure escapism and breezy, low-stakes drama.

They aren't allowed to express their feelings verbally. Instead, at the end of each episode, everyone sends a "heart signal" text to whomever they like. Meanwhile, a group of celebrity panelists follow along and predict who will end up together in the end.

Love Catcher brings this question to the forefront. Of the 10 strangers living together over several weeks, some are "love catchers" and some are "money catchers." If money catchers end the show coupled with a love catcher, they can walk away with a prize 50 million Korean won (about $36,000). As the contestants go after either love or money, a panel of hosts join the viewers in trying to suss out everyone's true motives.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://tubitv.com/series/300009823/love-catcher-2 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Watch on Tubi</a></p><h2 id=39-i-am-solo-39-3>'I Am Solo'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KuMuuAVPBoytxvqcMHr6jZ-1920-80.jpg><p>This show takes the whole living-together-and-dating concept to a more serious level, as all the singles who come onto the show are focused on marriage. The cast members search for a future spouse by discussing their ideal families, core values, and everything else you'd look for in a long-term partner. (And yes, the show has led to successful marriages.) And, instead of following the same group all the way through a season, matches are made quickly with new casts being added in every couple of episodes.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.viki.com/tv/38262c-i-am-solo#episodes referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Watch on VIki</a></p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-survival-competition-shows><span>Survival/Competition Shows</span></h2><p>Survivor stans, look no further.

This time, a group of celebs and comedians, who think they're about to serve on a dating show panel, are launched into a fight for survival. This show also straddles the line of scripted and unscripted (after all, contestants know that the "zombies" are actually a horde of talented background actors), but the fun comes through in the cast's spontaneous moments of fear, selfishness, or bravery.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.netflix.com/title/81635888 referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade rel="sponsored noopener" data-hl-processed=hawklinks data-placeholder-url=https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/100577549/type/dlg/sid/hawk-custom-tracking/https://www.netflix.com/title/81635888 data-google-interstitial=false data-merchant-name=netflix.com data-merchant-id=1070 data-merchant-url=netflix.com data-merchant-network=CJ>Watch on Netflix</a></p><h2 class=article-body__section id=section-lifestyle-celebrity-shows><span>Lifestyle/Celebrity Shows</span></h2><p>This side of the variety coin is filled with slice-of-life docusoaps that follow celebrities and public figures around as they live their daily lives. The plots can range from mundane daily activities to behind-the-scenes looks at their work lives. Some traits all the shows share: any drama that comes up is very low stakes, and often monitored by the ubiquitous celeb commentary panel.</p><h2 id=39-i-live-alone-39-3>'I Live Alone'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jCLaMCAyA8C2stxedNMMV4-1920-80.jpg><p>Also known as Home Alone, this lifestyle show (which just celebrated its 11th anniversary) follows the daily lives of celebrities who live alone, forgoing the cultural norm (Koreans often live with their immediate family until they move out to get married and start their own family). The guests who appear on the show record their daily activities, give testimonials, and even appear on the panel that watches along and comments on the footage. This hugely popular show is made for "people watchers," who find comfort in the fact that even famous celebrities struggle with stuff like cramped apartments and brutal hangovers.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.viki.com/tv/35553c-home-alone referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Watch on Viki</a></p><h2 id=39-return-of-superman-39-3>'Return of Superman'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/3g9rNVzKiSWcp9skceMKK7-1920-80.jpg><p>The premise of this family show is simple and often adorable. It follows celebrity dads as they take care of their kids...by themselves, while the moms get time off to relax. In the decade-plus since the show began, not all of the families have followed the exact scenario (sometimes the moms stick around to help) but two things never change: the kids are absolutely delightful, and celeb friends of the dads often pop by to help out. Some of the well-known dads over the show's history have included Physical: 100 alums Choo Sung-hoon and Kim Dong-hyun.</p><p><a data-analytics-id=inline-link href=# data-url=https://www.viki.com/tv/24715c-the-return-of-superman referrerpolicy=no-referrer-when-downgrade data-hl-processed=none>Watch on Viki</a></p><h2 id=39-jinny-39-s-kitchen-39-3>'Jinny's Kitchen'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/psoVSnL3BNrcqtSFhK2mrK-1920-80.jpg><p>This 2023 show is the latest in a series of specials where a group of actors open and operate a Korean restaurant in a tranquil corner of the world.

The celebs get to show off their personalities as they're put through variety-style games including the "famous people" quiz, word relays, and sport games where speaking in English is forbidden (which is always way harder than you'd think).

But fair warning: You won't find elaborate, full-body costumes or flashy performances with dozens of background dancers here. Instead, Korean celebrities with impressive voices (including many, many K-pop idols) get the chance to show off their pipes without any preconceived judgments based on their backgrounds.
