I was scrolling through Instagram and stumbled upon an image, clearly staged in that “stock photo” way (think <a href=# rel=nofollow>“women laughing alone with salad”</a>), of an attractive couple walking down the street.</p><p>The man appears to be mid wolf-whistle at a passing girl in a red dress, and the girlfriend responds with a look of disgust. Each of the three was labeled: the red-dress girl as “suicide,” the man as “me” and the angry girlfriend as “psychiatrist.” I laughed out loud at the dark humor playing out against such an innocuous scene.</p><h3 id=title-of-a-story class="c-title lrv-u-margin-b-075">Related Stories</h3><p>Little did I know that what I’d stumbled upon was the meme of the summer, commonly referred to online as “distracted boyfriend.” I’d soon be seeing that same stock-image photo proliferating across my various social media feeds.</p><p>The girl in the red dress was labeled everything from “the solar eclipse” to “a cold beer” to “socialism.” The boy became “Phil Collins,” “Henry the VIII” and, more often than not, “me.” And the girlfriend could be “books,” “bread” or — as memes tend to get self-referential after a while — “this meme.”</p><p>Some investigating led me to the man who took the photo, <a href=# rel=nofollow>Antonio <span data-scayt_word=Guillem data-scaytid=1>Guillem</span></a>, a professional advertising photographer from Barcelona, Spain. <span data-scayt_word=Guillem data-scaytid=2>Guillem</span>, 45, didn’t even know what a meme was until recently, when one of his models mentioned that another one of his photographs was turned into an internet joke.</p><p>But nothing prepared him for the global phenomenon that is “distracted boyfriend.” In the week since it exploded, the photo, one of many taken during a 2015 shoot in Catalonia, has registered millions of page impressions on Twitter, Facebook and beyond. <span data-scayt_word=Guillem data-scaytid=3>Guillem</span> theorizes the picture took off because it offers a “good foundation as a metaphor that works for almost everything.”</p><p>The models in the photo have worked with <span data-scayt_word=Guillem data-scaytid=5>Guillem</span> for years. They are choosing to remain anonymous, going only as Laura (the angry girlfriend) and Mario (the boy with the wandering eye).</p><p>Below is their first interview, with&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p><strong>What do you remember of this shoot?</strong></p><p><strong>Laura:</strong> For me it was a curious and funny photo shoot, especially when we had to make the photos like the meme, more humorous. When people saw us simulate those scenes in the street, they stopped to look and laugh. In my case I had to have a more serious face, and I had a hard time to keeping it. (Laughs.)</p><p><strong>Mario:</strong> I remember that it was kind of embarrassing because there were people watching and laughing and I had to make this silly face. But in the end, like we always do, I just forgot they were there and did my job. I remember it like a learning experience, and I had fun with my team.</p><p><strong>How did you discover the meme?</strong></p><p><strong>Laura:</strong> I started receiving notifications from my friends by tagging me on the posts they found on social media. Then Antonio sent us the first emails of interview requests he got about this photo, and I realized that it had become viral.</p><p><strong>Mario:</strong> People just started sending these memes to me, filling up my social media, even people I hadn’t seen for many years.</p><p><strong>What are some of your favorite labels that you’ve seen?</strong></p><p><strong>Laura:</strong> We have had a lot of work these last few weeks as we are trying to increase production. We have not paid much attention to everything posted on the net but I can say, by the little that I have seen, that people have a lot of imagination!</p><p><strong>Mario: </strong>As we are working really hard to give our clients the best quality photos we can make, I do not really have the time to follow these things, but for what I have seen I can say that it`s crazy what people can imagine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Are you being recognized on the street?</strong></p><p><strong>Laura: </strong>Maybe if I put the face of the meme someone could recognize me, but no, no one has recognized me yet. (Laughs.) Even some friends of mine told me, “Look, this girl looks like you,” and I said, “It’s me!”</p><p><strong>Mario:</strong> Not yet. (Laughs.)</p><p><strong>Have you ever been any of the three characters depicted in the photo in real life?</strong></p><p><strong>Laura:</strong> I think everyone once in their lives has been the girl in the red dress, maybe without being looked at with such brazenness. And I’ve never found myself in the situation that my boyfriend looks at a girl in that way so I’ve never been “my character” in real life.</p><p><strong>Mario:</strong>&nbsp;(Laughs.) I would never look someone like that in real life. And about the other two characters, well I am not so pretty.</p><p>See a few of the internet’s takes on the image below.</p><p dir=ltr lang=und><a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/<span data-scayt_word=UeIeiQnFrt data-scaytid=7>UeIeiQnFrt</span></a></p><p>— Omar <span data-scayt_word=Essam data-scaytid=8>Essam</span> <span data-scayt_word=LHC data-scaytid=9>LHC</span> (<span data-scayt_word=@OmarEssamLHC data-scaytid=10>@OmarEssamLHC</span>) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 19, 2017</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=und><a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/<span data-scayt_word=Ll1gM4N84J data-scaytid=11>Ll1gM4N84J</span></a></p><p>— Reverend Scott (@Reverend_Scott) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 23, 2017</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>these aren’t even jokes this is <span data-scayt_word=deadass data-scaytid=12>deadass</span> what happened <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/<span data-scayt_word=L15F8Ek9yC data-scaytid=13>L15F8Ek9yC</span></a></p><p>— got 707 <span data-scayt_word=livetweet data-scaytid=14>livetweet</span> (<span data-scayt_word=@ashaggreyjoy data-scaytid=15>@ashaggreyjoy</span>) <a href=# rel=nofollow>August 22, 2017</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8uinZ6rpK65pnvLop2eq6SuuaZ5zZ6urGeUnsC1vsCcq56cXZe8urLRopynnF2isqbAjKyrmqqjYrqmucRmqq6lnZq%2Fbn2PbGpvamNk</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdistracted-boyfriend-meet-stars-meme-summer-1033623.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fdistracted-boyfriend-meet-stars-meme-summer-1033623.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fdistracted-boyfriend-meet-stars-meme-summer-1033623.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fdistracted-boyfriend-meet-stars-meme-summer-1033623.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdistracted-boyfriend-meet-stars-meme-summer-1033623.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdistracted-boyfriend-meet-stars-meme-summer-1033623.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./michael-strahan-gma-co-stars-show-support-another-job-time-away.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./michael-strahan-gma-co-stars-show-support-another-job-time-away.html>Michael Strahan's GMA co-stars show support as he discusses 'another job' during time away</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./516777-lud-foe-recuperate-video-new-video.html>Lud Foe &amp;quot;Recuperate&amp;quot; Video</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./516777-lud-foe-recuperate-video-new-video.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
